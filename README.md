# Oasis Infobyte Internship Project

## Overview

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I had the opportunity to work on diverse and challenging projects in the field of machine learning and data science. The experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and enhance my skills in problem-solving and data analysis.

## Tasks

### 1. Iris Dataset Classification

Implemented a machine learning model for classifying the famous Iris dataset.
The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application
of various classification algorithms to accurately categorize iris flowers based on their features.

### 2. Car Price Prediction

Developed a predictive model for estimating car prices using regression techniques.
This project required data cleaning, feature selection, and the application of regression
algorithms to predict car prices based on relevant features such as make_year, Transmission, Fuel type, and more.

### 3. Spam Detector

Created a spam detection system utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
The project involved text preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of classification
algorithms to identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones.

### 4. Sales Prediction

Worked on a sales prediction project where the goal was to forecast future sales based on historical data.
This task involved Data Analysis, feature engineering, and the application of predictive modeling
to provide insights into future sales trends.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis

## Lessons Learned

This internship at Oasis Infobyte not only enhanced my technical skills
 but also provided valuable insights into the practical aspects of machine learning
and data science. I gained hands-on experience in preprocessing data, selecting appropriate models, and evaluating their performance.
